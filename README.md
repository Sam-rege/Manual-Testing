# Manual-Testing
### Manual Testing and Its Importance in SDLC/STLC and Agile Methodologies

#### Introduction

Manual testing is a fundamental aspect of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) and the software testing lifecycle (STLC). It involves testers manually executing test cases without the use of automation tools. The purpose of manual testing is to identify defects, ensure software quality, and verify that the application functions as expected from an end-user perspective.

#### Importance in SDLC

1. **Early Bug Detection**: Manual testing enables early identification of defects, which can be addressed before they become more complex and costly to fix in later stages.

2. **Usability Testing**: Testers can assess the applicationâ€™s user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) to ensure it is intuitive and user-friendly.

3. **Adaptability**: Manual testing is highly flexible, allowing testers to adjust to changes in requirements and explore the application in ways automated scripts cannot.

4. **Exploratory Testing**: Testers can explore the application beyond predefined test cases, identifying potential issues that automated tests might miss.

5. **Human Insight**: Manual testing provides human insight, intuition, and creativity, which are essential for identifying subtle issues and understanding the user perspective.

#### Importance in STLC

1. **Requirement Analysis**: Manual testers participate in reviewing and analyzing requirements to ensure they are clear, complete, and testable.

2. **Test Planning**: Manual testing plays a crucial role in creating comprehensive test plans, including test objectives, scope, approach, and resources.

3. **Test Case Development**: Testers design and develop detailed test cases and test scripts based on requirements and use cases.

4. **Test Execution**: Manual test execution involves running the test cases, recording results, and identifying defects for further investigation.

5. **Defect Tracking and Management**: Testers log and track defects, collaborate with developers for resolution, and retest fixes to ensure issues are resolved.

6. **Test Closure**: Testers contribute to test closure activities, including the evaluation of test completion criteria, preparation of test summary reports, and retrospective analysis for process improvement.

#### Importance in Agile Methodologies

1. **Continuous Feedback**: Manual testing provides continuous feedback throughout the development cycle, ensuring quick identification and resolution of issues.

2. **Collaboration**: Manual testers work closely with developers, product owners, and stakeholders, fostering collaboration and communication within agile teams.

3. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: Agile projects often undergo frequent changes. Manual testing allows for quick adaptation to new requirements and changes.

4. **Incremental Testing**: In Agile, software is developed incrementally. Manual testing ensures each increment is tested thoroughly before moving to the next.

5. **Acceptance Testing**: Manual testers perform acceptance testing to validate that the software meets business requirements and is ready for production.

#### Testing Deliverables/Artifacts in SDLC/STLC and Agile

1. **Test Plans**: Detailed documents outlining the testing strategy, objectives, scope, resources, schedule, and activities.

2. **Test Cases**: Specific conditions under which a new functionality is tested to verify compliance with requirements.

3. **Test Scripts**: Step-by-step instructions for executing test cases, including expected results.

4. **Defect Reports**: Documentation of any bugs or issues discovered during testing, including steps to reproduce, severity, and status.

5. **Test Summary Reports**: Summarize the results of the testing activities, including pass/fail status, defect density, and coverage metrics.

6. **Traceability Matrix**: Maps test cases to requirements to ensure all requirements are covered by tests.

7. **Test Data**: Data used during test execution to validate scenarios.

8. **Test Metrics and KPIs**: Measurements that provide insights into the effectiveness and efficiency of the testing process.

#### Conclusion

Manual testing remains a critical component of both SDLC/STLC and Agile methodologies. It ensures that software products are user-friendly, functional, and free of critical defects. By providing human insight and flexibility, manual testing complements automated testing and plays a vital role in delivering high-quality software. The deliverables and artifacts produced during manual testing activities provide valuable documentation and metrics that support informed decision-making and continuous improvement in the development process.
